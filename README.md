# Growing_l-system

Extend l-system to using 3D model and add growing feature

1. Create recursive class structure while reading rules.
2. Calculate position (start&end) of each line then create transform matrix for model.
3. Control size (length) of model by accumulated time step.

## Future Feature
1. Increasing size in horizontal-axis (width).
2. More general algorithm for other tree types.
